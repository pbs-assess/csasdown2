<!-- JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas. For this
reason, we require that authors include in the paper some sentences that
explain the software functionality and domain of use to a non-specialist
reader. We also require that authors explain the research applications of the
software. The paper should be between 750-1750 words. Authors submitting papers
significantly longer than 1750 words may be asked to reduce the length of their
paper. -->

<!-- Community guidelines: Are there clear guidelines for third parties wishing
to 1) Contribute to the software 2) Report issues or problems with the software
3) Seek support -->

<!-- Note the paper should not include software documentation such as API
(Application Programming Interface) functionality, as this should be outlined
in the software documentation. -->

# Summary

<!-- A description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software
for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

# Statement of need

<!-- A section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software
and places it in the context of related work. This should clearly state what
problems the software is designed to solve, who the target audience is, and its
relation to other work. -->

# State of the field

[@bookdown]

<!-- A description of how this software compares to other commonly-used
packages in the research area. If related tools exist, provide a clear “build
vs. contribute” justification explaining your unique scholarly contribution and
why existing alternatives are insufficient. -->

# Software design

<!-- An explanation of the trade-offs you weighed, the design/architecture you
chose, and why it matters for your research application. This should
demonstrate meaningful design thinking beyond a superficial code structure
description. -->

# Research impact statement

<!-- Evidence of realized impact (publications, external use, integrations) or
credible near-term significance (benchmarks, reproducible materials,
community-readiness signals). The evidence should be compelling and specific,
not aspirational. -->

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }

# AI usage disclosure

Author use: The use of generative AI is permitted for most aspects of a JOSS submission (e.g., software creation and review, generating documentation, assisting with paper authoring), however all such use must be disclosed in an "AI usage disclosure" statement which includes:

Tool use: The tools/models used (and versions) and where they were used (code, paper text, docs).
The nature and scope of assistance: e.g., code generation, refactoring, test scaffolding, copy-editing, drafting.
Confirmation of review: Authors must assert that human authors reviewed, edited, validated all AI-assisted outputs and made the core design decisions.
